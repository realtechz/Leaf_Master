# Leaf-Disease-Classifier

* Leaf Disease Classifier classifies disease based on image processing techniques for automated vision system used at agricultural field. 

* The classifier is trained on the dataset found at

## Disease Classifier

The whole disease classification process is divided into 2 stages as in 

- 8 CNN classifiers are trained to identify the diseases of each of the 8 plant classes.  The result from stage 2 is used to call the classifier that has been trained to classify the different diseases for that plant. If there are none, the leaf would be classified as 'Healthy'.

- All the above CNN's are trained on a Deep Residual Network- ResNet-50 Architecture using "Transfer Learning" from the ImageNet weights.

# How-To-Train:


## Run Model

- To run and setup the model, youâ€™ll need at least OpenCV 3.4.2.
